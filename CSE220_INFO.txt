# Changes:
In order to cross compile for riscv64, the file abc_global.h was modified to define types for the ISA.
The Makefile has been adjusted to use the riscv64-linux-gnu toolchain, and to use static linking
Test.c is the program to be ran on ESESC. It can be dropped into the ESESC bins folder without dependencies.
It is meant to represent a typical synthesis on ABC.


# Input file:
fpu_orig.bench from OpenABC is used as the target for ABC in test.c
It can be found in this repository: https://github.com/NYU-MLDA/OpenABC
Usage for test is as follows:
test /path/to/folder/containing/fpu_orig.bench
This file was selected as a realistic workload for abc

# To compile:
make libabc.a ABC_USE_NO_READLINE=1
riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc -static -Wall -g -c test.c -o test.o
riscv64-linux-gnu-g++ -static -g -o test test.o libabc.a -lm -ldl -lpthread

# To run on esesc:
Follow test compilation instructions
Copy test to ~/build/run/bins
Make the directory ~/build/run/data/fpu
Copy fpu_orig.bench to ~/build/run/data/fpu
Copy abc.sh to ~/build/run
Move to ~/build/run and run abc.sh
